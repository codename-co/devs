  'AI Augmentation for Everyone',
  '{product} is a browser-native AI agent orchestration platform. Delegate complex tasks to teams of specialised agents that plan, collaborate, and deliver — all running',
  'entirely on your device',
  '\u201CAI augmentation shouldn\u2019t be a luxury for the few, but a fundamental tool available to all — where anyone can leverage the power of AI teams to amplify their capabilities and achieve their goals.\u201D',

  // Principles section
  'Philosophy',
  'Built on Conviction',
  'Three non-negotiable principles guide every decision we make.',
  'Privacy by Design',
  'Every byte of your data stays on your device. No servers. No telemetry. No compromise.',
  'Universally Accessible',
  'A browser is all you need. No installation, no GPU, no special hardware — just open and create.',
  'Open Source Forever',
  'Built in the open, shaped by the community. Every line of code is yours to read, improve, and share.',

  // Capabilities section
  'Capabilities',
  'Powerful by Design',
  'A depth of engineering so you can focus on what matters — your ideas.',
  'Multi-Agent Orchestration',
  'Collective Intelligence',
  'Compose teams of specialised AI agents that plan, execute, and validate together — mirroring how the best human teams operate.',
  'Provider Independence',
  'Your Models, Your Choice',
  'Seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Never locked in.',
  'Zero-Trust Architecture',
  'Security as a Foundation',
  'Web Crypto API encrypts your tokens. Service Workers sandbox execution. IndexedDB keeps everything local. Defense in depth, by default.',
  'Intelligent Task Analysis',
  'Complexity, Simplified',
  'An LLM-powered analyser breaks your request into requirements, recruits the right agents, resolves dependencies, and orchestrates delivery.',
  'Offline-First & P2P',
  'Works Anywhere',
  'Fully functional without internet after first load. Optional Yjs-powered P2P sync lets you collaborate across devices without a central server.',
  'Extensible by Nature',
  'Build on Top',
  'A marketplace of agents, tools, connectors, and apps — plus a sandboxed Extension Bridge so the community can create and share new capabilities.',

  // How it works section
  'Getting Started',
  'Four Steps to Delegation',
  'From prompt to polished output in minutes, not hours.',
  'Configure your AI provider',
  'Connect your preferred LLM — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, or any compatible endpoint.',
  'Describe your task',
  'Tell DEVS what you need in natural language. Be ambitious — the orchestrator thrives on complexity.',
  'Watch agents collaborate',
  'See specialised agents plan, execute, and validate in real-time. Intervene, guide, or just observe.',
  'Receive & refine',
  'Get structured artefacts — code, docs, analyses — and iterate with feedback until it\u2019s right.',

  // Use cases section
  'For Everyone',
  'Built for Builders',
  'Whether you\u2019re writing code or writing prose — DEVS adapts to you.',

  // FAQ section
  'FAQ',
  'Common Questions',
  'Is my data private?',
  'Absolutely. All processing happens locally in your browser. We never collect, transmit, or store any of your data. Your API keys are encrypted with the Web Crypto API and never leave your device.',
  'Which AI providers are supported?',
  'We support {providers}, and any provider compatible with the OpenAI API specification. You can switch providers at any time without losing your conversations or data.',
  'Do I need to install anything?',
  'Nothing at all. DEVS is a Progressive Web App that runs entirely in your browser. You can optionally \u201Cinstall\u201D it to your home screen for a native-like experience, but it\u2019s never required.',
  'Is this really free and open source?',
  'Yes — {license} licensed and always will be. The entire codebase is on GitHub. You can self-host, fork, or contribute. No premium tiers, no paywalls.',
  'Can I use it offline?',
  'After the first load, the Service Worker caches everything you need. You can create agents, manage knowledge, and review past conversations without any internet connection. LLM calls obviously require connectivity to the provider.',
  'How does multi-agent orchestration work?',
  'When you describe a complex task, the built-in orchestrator analyses it, breaks it into subtasks, recruits specialised agents, resolves dependencies, and coordinates parallel execution — just like a well-run project team.',
