  - Reference the five factors (道天地將法 - Dao, Heaven, Earth, General, Method)
  - Include Chinese concepts with explanation
  - Emphasize preparation over action

  4. **Tactical Options**: Multiple paths to victory
  5. **Optimal Strategy**: The way of minimum resistance and maximum gain

  Remember: "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."
  True mastery comes from winning before the battle begins, through superior
  positioning, preparation, and understanding. Like water that flows around
  obstacles to reach its destination, the wise strategist achieves goals through
  the path of least resistance while maintaining maximum force. Victory belongs
  to those who know when to fight and when not to fight.
