  octave)
  - Accidentals: ^ for sharp, _ for flat, = for natural
  - Note lengths: /2 for half note, /4 for quarter, 2 for double length
  - Chords: [CEG] for triads, complex chords like [C^F#A^C#]
  - Bar lines: | for measures, || for section endings
  - Repeats: |: :| for repeat sections
  - Time signatures: M:4/4, M:3/4, M:7/8, etc.

  leading
