  title: Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
  description: >
    Systematic method for identifying potential failures in a design, process, or system.
    FMEA evaluates failure modes, their causes, and effects to prioritize risk mitigation.
    Uses Risk Priority Number (RPN) to rank and address the most critical failure modes.

      title: 고장 모드 및 영향 분석
      description: >
        설계, 프로세스 또는 시스템에서 잠재적 고장을 식별하는 체계적인 방법.
        FMEA는 고장 모드, 그 원인 및 영향을 평가하여 위험 완화의 우선순위를 정합니다.
        위험 우선순위 번호(RPN)를 사용하여 가장 중요한 고장 모드를 순위를 매기고 해결합니다.
